# Python for Transportation Modeling

This course provides a basic introduction on the use of Python for
transportation planning and modeling.  It includes a brief review
of the fundamentals of writing code in Python, as well as modules
on tabular data analysis, visualizations, and geographic analysis.
The course assumes that students are already somewhat familiar with
the mathematical tools of transportation modeling in general, and
focuses exclusively on the how these models are constructed and
implemented within Python.

The [first version](http://www.fsutmsonline.net/fdot-python/fdot-python-html/index.html) 
of this course was developed with funding provided by the Florida 
Department of Transportation.

This version of the course is hosted on Github, and thus can be run 
from inside [Binder](https://mybinder.org),
a free online server for Jupyter and Python.  The resources available
on this service are limited, and you likely will not find them satisfactory
for production-level transportation planning and analysis work for
nearly any purpose. However, they are sufficient to run the code demonstrated
in these training exercises, and **you will not need to install anything
on your local machine** beyond a standard web browser, which you 
undoubtedly already have.
